    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
            RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> specifies a proactive distance-vector
            based routing scheme. The protocol creates a DAG-like structure
            which operates with a given "Mode of Operation" (MOP) determining the
            minimal and mandatory set of primitives to be supported by all the
            participating nodes.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document adds a notion of capabilities using which nodes in the
            network could inform its peers about its additional capabilities.
            This document highlights the differences of capabilities from that
            of Mode of operation and explains the necessity of it.

            <t>
                MOP: Mode of Operation. Identifies the MOP of the RPL Instance

                Caps: Abbreviated term used for Capabilities.
            </t>

            <t>
                DAO: DODAG Advertisement Object. An RPL message used to
                advertise the target information in order to establish routing
                adjacencies.
            </t>

            <t>
                DIO: DODAG Information Object. An RPL message initiated by the

        <section anchor="cap-what" title="What are Capabilities?">
            <t>
                Currently RPL specification does not have a mechanism whereby a
                node can signal the set of features that are available on its
                end.  Such a mechanism could help the root to advertise its
                capabilities and in response also determine some advanced
                information about the capabilities of the joining nodes.  This
                document defines Capabilities which could be supported by the
                nodes and handshaked as part of RPL signaling. Capabilities are
                embedded as RPL control message option as defined Section 6.7
                of <xref target = "RFC6550"/> in the base messages of DIO, DAO
                and DAO-ACK signaling.

    <section anchor="requirements" title="Requirements for this document">
        <t>
            Following are the requirements considered for this documents:
            <list style="format REQ%d:">
                <t>
                    Backwards compatibility. The new options and new fields in
                    the DIO message should be backward compatible i.e. if there
                    are nodes which support old MOPs they could still operate
                    in their own instances.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Optional capabilities handshake. Capabilities are features,
                    possibly optional, which could be handshaked between the
                    nodes and the root within an RPL Instance.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Capabilities handshake could be optionally added with
                    existing MOPs. Capabilities been optional in nature could
                    be put to use with existing MOPs. Capabilities and
                    MOP-extension is mutually independent i.e. a DIO can have a
                    capabilities option, MOP-extension option or both in the
                    same message.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Capabilities could be explicitly queried.
                </t>
            </list>
        </t>
        <section anchor="cap-why" title="How are Capabilities different from existing RPL primitives?">
            <t>
                The Mode of Operation (MOP) field in RPL mandates the
                operational requirement for the nodes joining as routers. MOP
                and DIO Configuration Option is strictly controlled by the Root
                node in RPL. Intermediate 6LRs cannot modify these fields.
                Also, the MOP never changes for the lifetime of the RPL
                Instance. Changes in DIO Configuration Option are possible but
                are rare. Capabilities, on the other hand, might change
                more dynamically.
            </t>
            <t>
                RPL DIO message also carries routing metrics and constraints as
                specified in <xref target="RFC6551"/>. Metrics and constraints
                are used as part of objective function which aids in node's
                rank calculation. A router may use capabilities carried in DIO
                message as additional metrics/constraints. However,
                capabilities have a larger scope and may be carried in other
                messages other than DIO and can flow in both the directions
                (upstream and downstream).

        </t>
        <t>
            Note that capabilities and MOPex are mutually exclusive and it is
            possible for an implementation to support either or both of the
            options.

                The root node could advertise the set of capabilities it
                supports in the DIO message. A node could take advantage of the
                knowledge that the root supports a particular capability.
                Similarly a node could advertise its capabilities in the DAO
                message using the capability control message option defined in
                this document. Capabilities advertised by non-root nodes are

                NCSS is a sequence counter following the sequence operation
                as mentioned in Section 7.2 of RFC6550 and is used by the node to
                synchronize the capability set. The querying node will use this
                to check if it has the latest capability set from the node. NCSS
                may change only if any element of the capability set changes.
                Note that NCSS is applicable for the whole capability set and
                not individual capability. The idea is that the capability set
                will change infrequently hence a common NCSS is sufficient for
                all Caps. If the querying node is not aware of the last known
                NCSS of the target node then it sets the NCSS to 0.

                The 'J' (join) flag can be set in context to a capability
                either by a 6LR or the root. The 'J' flag indicates that if the
                capability is not supported by a node then it can join the
                instance only as a 6LN (or do not join as 6LR).

            <t>
                The 'C' (copy) flag is set by the node indicating that the

                        On receiving a capability it does not support, the node

                Storing mode of operation requires each intermediate router
                in the LLN to maintain routing states' information in the
                routing table. LLN routers typically operate with
                constraints on processing power, memory, and energy
                (battery power). Memory limits the number of routing states
                an LR and BR can maintain.  When the routing table of an LR
                or BR is full, it will either reject the new DAO messages
                received or will use some replacement policy to remove a
                routing entry and add the new one. Rejection of DAO
                messages will lead to an increase in DAO message
                transmission that impacts the energy and network
                convergence time.  Routing state replacement leads to
                downward path downtime.

                One possible way to solve problems due to routing table
                size constraint is to use this information to add neighbors
                to the DAO parent set. Routing resource capability can be
                used by LR and BR to advertise their current routing table
                usage details in the network. LR or LNs in LLN can use this
                information in the selection of the DAO parent set. PCE can
                use this information to select intermediate routers for the
                projected routes. Routing Resource is an optional capability.

                A neighbor cache maintains neighboring one-hop connected
                nodes information such as MAC address, link-local IP
                address and other reachability state information needed for
                layer two communication.Node density has direct
                implications on the neighbor cache. In the constrained
                network scenario the size of the neighbor cache will be
                limited. Thus there are chances that a node may not be able
                to store all the neighboring nodes in its cache and use
                replacement algorithms to evict some of the entries to
                accommodate the new one.  If the replaced neighbor has
                installed a DAO route on it then it can lead to packet loss
                or additional address resolution message exchange.  To
                avoid unnecessary replacement of neighbor cache entries
                neighbor cache management policy <xref
                    target="I-D.ietf-lwig-nbr-mgmt-policy"/> proposes a
                solution that will put a restriction on the connectivity to
                immediate neighbor depending upon the type of neighbor.
                But this won't solve the problem unless until the
                availability of neighbor cache is not taken into
                consideration while selecting the DAO parent set.

                Neighbor Cache capability can be used by LR and BR to
